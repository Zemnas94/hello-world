I'm a 23yo general nerd from the upstate new york area. My intrests range from biochem to physics and I'm on my way to an associates in Cybersecurity. I've been advised by multiple individuals to persue either computer science as my programing teacher's have been impressed in the past as well as possibly engaging in a more science intensive career as I have a deep facination with pharmacology and organic chemistry. Right now I'm looking for work and just kinda finding myself.
